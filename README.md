# java-web-maven-spring-thyme-secure-3des-encrypt-scrypt-encoded

## Description
A springboot secure web app with thymeleaf support.
Three roles are defined; USER, ADMIN, and SUPER. All roles
can access pages `/home`, `/login`, and `/about`. Only USER
can access `/user` and ADMIN only `/admin` whereas SUPER can
navigate to either and have its own `/super`. Each role
has an action USER=VIEW ONLY, ADMIN=READ/WRITE, SUPER=CREATE.
All password are encrypted with 3DES and encoded with scrypt
to insure strong passwords.

3-DES is a 128 byte encryption but a 256 byte AES generated key
was used for the md5 digest password.
